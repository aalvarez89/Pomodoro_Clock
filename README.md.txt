#Pomodoro_clock

This is a project for freeCodeCamp.

The project features a responsive Pomodoro Clock timed for a 25 minutes session and a 5 minutes break session. The timer is represented by a tomato that spins twice (once per session), the session timings can be modified with the +/- buttons.

The timer is activated by pressing on the tomato and is cancelled by pressing on the X-shaped button under the tomato.

Lastly, the clock is animated spins through the JavaScript animation API instead of the old-fashioned CSS animations, giving me the capability to use promises to chain animations and trigger events such as the end of the session beep sound.
